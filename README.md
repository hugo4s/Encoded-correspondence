# Coded Correspondence Project

## Overview
The Coded Correspondence project is an exploration of cryptography using Python programming. In this project, you'll decipher encoded messages and encode your own responses using various cryptographic techniques. The project involves decoding Caesar Ciphers, encoding messages using Caesar Cipher, decoding messages without knowing the shift value, and understanding and using the Vigenère Cipher.

## Project Goals
- **Decoding Caesar Ciphers**: Decode messages encoded using Caesar Ciphers with known shift values.
- **Encoding Caesar Ciphers**: Encode messages using Caesar Ciphers.
- **Brute Force Decoding**: Crack Caesar Cipher messages without knowing the shift value through brute force.
- **Understanding Vigenère Cipher**: Learn about the Vigenère Cipher and its operation.
- **Decoding Vigenère Cipher**: Decode messages encoded using the Vigenère Cipher.
- **Encoding Vigenère Cipher**: Encode messages using the Vigenère Cipher.
