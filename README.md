# Project: Encoded Correspondence

## Description

During the project, we worked with our friend and pen pal, Vishal, exchanging encoded messages. Here's a summary of the activities conducted:

1. **Decoding Vishal's Message:** We decoded a message from Vishal which utilized the Caesar cipher with a shift of 10 characters.

2. **Sending a Encoded Message to Vishal:** We responded to Vishal with an encoded message using the same 10-character shift.

3. **Creation of Decoding and Encoding Functions:** We implemented functions to decode and encode messages using the Caesar cipher, making it easier to manipulate encoded messages.

4. **Decoding a Message without Knowing the Shift:** We brute-forced the decoding of a message from Vishal, where he didn't provide the shift used in the Caesar cipher.

5. **Introduction to Vigenère Cipher:** We learned about the Vigenère cipher and implemented functions to decode and encode messages using this cipher.

6. **Sending a Message with Vigenère Cipher:** We created a function to encode messages using the Vigenère cipher and sent an encoded message to Vishal.
